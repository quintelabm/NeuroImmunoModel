# NeuroImmunoModel

Mathematical Model of the Activation of the Immune Response in the Central Nervous System. 

## Description

This mathematical model of differential equations was based on the works of Lombardo et al (2017) and Quintela et al (2014) to represent spatio-temporal dynamics of the immune response causing brain damage in the context of multiple sclerosis.

We expect it can be used to study other diseases related to inflammation.
